# Intorduction to Javascript and Interactive Charts and Graphs

## Description:
In this week, you will explore the fundamentals of JavaScript, focusing on variables, data types, functions, and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). Additionally, you will implement interactive charts and graphs using Chart.js. This assignment will provide hands-on experience with JavaScript programming and data visualization techniques.

## Requirements:

### JavaScript Fundamentals:
        Create an HTML file named index.html.
        Include a <script> tag to link an external JavaScript file named script.js.
        Implement JavaScript code to cover the following concepts:
            Declare variables of different data types (string, number, boolean).
            Define and call functions to perform simple operations; name them as follows:
            add
            subtract
            divide
            multiply.
            Use console.log() to print output and debug code.

### DOM Manipulation:
        Expand your index.html file to include elements for user interaction (e.g., buttons, input fields).
        Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM in response to user actions. For example, update text content, change styles, or show/hide elements based on user input.
        Implement event listeners to handle user interactions (e.g., click events, input events).
        Ensure that your DOM manipulation code enhances the interactivity and usability of the web page.

### Interactive Charts and Graphs:
        Integrate the Chart.js library into your project by adding the necessary <script> tag to your HTML file.
        Create a canvas element in your HTML file to render the chart.

  ### Submission:
        Submit the link to your GitHub repository for evaluation, through the github classroom.
